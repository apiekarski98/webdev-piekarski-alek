My name is Alek Piekarski. I am a third year undergraduate student at Northeastern pursuing a combined degree in computer science and mathematics. I just finished my first co-op at SessionM, where I worked in QA but also got some mobile development experience. Currently, I am working on building a website for my fraternity using a Bootstrap template. By the end of this course, I hope to make a much better website that has more functionality than just being informational. 

This repository is specifically for the web development class (CS5610).
